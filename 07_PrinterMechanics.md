# **Chapter 7: Introduction to Printer Mechanics (Version 1.0)** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Mesh and Model Generation
* Print orientation
* Rafts (i.e., first layer support)
* Infill and shell thickness
* Support Materials
* Removing support from different printer types.
* Types of failure (i.e., printer and model).
* Slicing basics
* UP! Printer and Software basics.

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.
