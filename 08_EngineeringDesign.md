# **Chapter 8: Design and Engineering of 3D printed parts** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Discuss "Fit for purpose"
* Mass, Weight and Force.
* Stress, Strain and Examples.
* Material interfaces.
* Exercise: Bend beams printed in different orientations.
* Exercise: Bend small brackets with round and sharp corners.
* Introduction to testing standards (e.g., ASTM D638).

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.
