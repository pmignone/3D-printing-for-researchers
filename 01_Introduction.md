# **Chapter 1: Introduction (Version 1.0)** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Pre-Event and Registration
* Introduces the presenters
* Provides some basic information about the attendees.
* Course objectives, setup and overview.
* Exercise: Print a Stanford Bunny
* High level introduction to 3D printing

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.

## Pre-Event ##

	The pre-event section may be created as it's own markdown file. 
	To be determined later...

The Digital Blacksmith (#digismith) course notes were created for the [University of Melbourne's 3D Printing Summer School](http://theconversation.com/researchers-can-be-digital-blacksmiths-with-3d-printers-23475), held in February 2014. This was a five-day course, which covered a broad array topics from 3D printing, 3D modelling, materials, design, social and legal aspects.

A significant amount of preparation went into this course, and it required a huge amount of effort from University staff, students, trainers and attendees. The following is a summary of all things done pre-event to make #digismith a reality:

* **Course announcement and expressions of interest (EOI):** Naturally, the first step will be to make sure staff and students interested in these fields are aware that such a course exists. The first #digismith course used last year's [3D Printing Showcase](http://digitalfabrication.unimelb.edu.au/3dprintingshowcase2013) as a platform to do this. It was also followed up with direct advertising to relevant research groups interested in using 3D printing. A google document (spreadsheet) was prepared for people to access in order to register their interest.

* **Interviews of potential attendees:** After attendees have registered their interest, we required a mechanism to ensure that those that expressed interested would later attend the course. A price mechanism wasn't considered as the first iteration of #digismith was free of charge. Therefore each person that filled out an EOI were invited to sit down (or skype) for a 10-15 minute interview. The interview asked the following quesitons:


	1. What is their academic background was (course and department)?
	2. When was the best time to hold the course (i.e., if there are a list of dates)?
	3. What is their interest in 3D printing?
	4. What experience have they had with 3D printing and relevant 3D printing software thus far (e.g., programming, CAD, 3D simulation etc.)
	5. What are they hoping to learn from the course?

	Please note that the interviews we're not used to 'screen out' potential candidates. Only those that did not do an interview we're not considered for the course. The interviews we're also valuable in detrmining what to include in the #digismith course, as well as providing information about where the interest in 3D printing was at the University.

* **Invitations to attendees:** The number of places for #digismith was limited to 24 places and there we over 30 interviews conducted. Therefore a courtesy email was sent to all candidates informing them that registrations would be limited and done on a 'first come first serve principle'. Those that missed out would be placed on a shortlist and invited should any cancellations occurred. A few days later, invitations we're sent via [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) to all candidates.


* **Workshop Space:** To be continued...
