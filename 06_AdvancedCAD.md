# **Chapter 6: Introduction to Advanced CAD with Blender (Version 1.0)** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Introduction to Blender
* Blender Workshop 1
* Blender Workshop 2

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.

# Exercise 1: Low-Poly House #

## 1.0 Objective ##

In this first step-by-step tutorial, we'll build the low-poly house model shown in Figure 1. This text description is also accompanied by a video tutorial, which may be easier to follow.

[Insert Fig]
Figure 1: Final low-poly house.

Low-poly modeling such as this is commonly used for things like models in computer games, for which the total number of polygons in the model should be kept as low as possible. The objective of this tutorial is not so much to focus on good low-poly model creation, but rather to introduce very basic mesh editing methods.

## 2.0 Procedure ##

**2.1 3D view navigation**

Before starting, we should review the navigation of the 3D viewport. Blender has been designed to support a 3-button mouse, so if you are using a mouse with fewer buttons, you should perform mouse clicks using combinations of modifier keys as shown in Table 1.

[Insert Tab]
Table 1: Equivalent modifier keys for mouse buttons.

If you wish to emulate the 3-button mouse, this must be activated in User Preferences. To
activate 3-button emulation, choose File User Preferencesâ€¦ from the Info view menu at the
top of the Blender window. This should display a User Preferences dialog. In the dialog,
click on the Input tab, and then select the Emulate 3 Button Mouse check box. The User
Preferences dialog can be dismissed simply by closing the window.
