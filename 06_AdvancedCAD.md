# **Chapter 6: Introduction to Advanced CAD with Blender (Version 1.0)** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Introduction to Blender
* Blender Workshop 1
* Blender Workshop 2

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.
