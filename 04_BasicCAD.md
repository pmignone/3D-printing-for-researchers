# **Chapter 4: Introduction to Lightweight CAD Modelling (Version 1.0)** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Understand the value of rapid prototyping testing / iteration.
* Utilizing lightweight CAD tools-methods for rapid prototyping.
* Basic CAD designs with 3DTin.
* Avoid the limitations in utilizing HTML5 CAD.
* Produce your first team innovation to print.

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.
