# **Chapter 5: Introduction to 3D Printing Materials (Version 1.0)** #

The following chapter introduces the following:

* Basic Material Properties (e.g., material types and physical properties).
* Discuss "Fit for purpose"
* Advanced material properties (e.g., mechanical and thermal properties).
* View PLA material properties as an example.

Some of the content will be specific to the 3D printing course notes used to generate this chapter and others (view README.md for the PDF version). This content should be changed to make it more applicable for your specific requirements.

	My general comments and reasoning for content will be placed in code blocks.
	These blocks are not part of the course and are for your information only.
